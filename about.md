Founded in July 2024, the association ***C**ercle **A**ssociati**f** des J**e**unes Chercheurs et Chercheuses de l'IRISA - **Café!**‎* succeeds to [ADOC](https://adoc.irisa.fr), the former association for IRISA's Ph.D. students. 

As ADOC disapeared in 2019, we decided to create *Café!*, a non-profit organization (*Association de Loi 1901*) dedicated for every Ph.D. students, post-docs, research engineers and interns of the lab.

## Goals

The association have multiple goals:
- Ease the integration of Ph.D. students, post-docs, research engineers and interns in the laboratory.
- Provide useful documents to newcommers.
- Organize various events to entertain and enrich the socio-cultural life of the laboratory.

### In practice…?

In practice, our “sphere of influence” is limited to the IRISA. Our activities include several social events, the writing of a newcomer’s guide, presentations, information posters, sports… **Everyone can propose a new activity or restore former propositions**, it’s up to you to make this “legacy” alive…


## Café!'s Lore

You might ask Why is the association is called *Café!* ?

Coffee (*café* in french) has an important place at the lab due to the many coffee breaks we take. But most importantly, as Ph.D. students, you might know that coffee is essential to our survival! 


## Board

Since July 2024, the board of *Café!* is composed by:
- **Hector** Chabot, president
- **Florian** Roudot, treasurer
- **Lucas** Roquet, secretary
